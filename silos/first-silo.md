# Your first silo

You have a cluster with a worker ([Installing]({{ '/setup/prepare/' | relative_url }})). Now make a microVM, watch it come
up, and step inside.

---

## Describe it

Save this as `hello.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: kevaso/v1
kind: Namespace
metadata: { name: demo }
---
apiVersion: kevaso/v1
kind: Silo
metadata: { name: hello, namespace: demo }
spec:
  runtime: cloud-hypervisor        # a microVM with its own kernel and network card
  image: ubuntu-24.04
  resources: { cpu: 1, memory: 1Gi }
  disk: { size: 10Gi }             # its own disk, kept for its whole life
  init:                            # run inside, in order, before it's Ready
    steps:
      - name: hello
        run: echo "hello from $(hostname)" > /root/hello
      - name: python
        shell: python3             # any interpreter in the image
        run: |
          import platform; print("kernel", platform.release())
```

| Field | Means |
|---|---|
| `runtime` | What kind of silo: here a microVM. Others in [Runtimes]({{ '/silos/runtimes/' | relative_url }}). |
| `image` | What it boots. `ubuntu-24.04` is built in (downloaded once per host, digest-checked). |
| `resources` | CPUs and memory it may use. The scheduler only places it where they fit. |
| `disk` | Its root disk. It lives on the host it was created on. |
| `init.steps` | Scripts, run as root inside the silo, in order. The silo is Ready only after the last one succeeds. |

---

## Create it

```bash
bin/kvo apply -f hello.yaml
```

```bash
bin/kvo watch silos -n demo
```

```
NOW  silo/demo/hello  phase=Pending  host=-
NOW  silo/demo/hello  phase=Scheduled  host=hv1
NOW  silo/demo/hello  phase=Starting  host=hv1  Ready: creating on hv1
NOW  silo/demo/hello  phase=Starting  host=hv1  init=0/2  Ready: init step hello
NOW  silo/demo/hello  phase=Running  host=hv1  init=2/2  address=10.64.1.2
```

The first silo on a host takes a few minutes (the image is copied onto its disk); later ones are
faster. Ctrl-C stops watching, not the silo.

---

## Look at it

```bash
bin/kvo get silos -n demo
```

```bash
bin/kvo describe silo hello -n demo
```

`describe` shows everything about it: where it runs, its address, its init steps with their exit
codes and durations, and its conditions (the *why* when something isn't Ready).

---

## Step inside

```bash
bin/kvo exec silo hello -n demo -- cat /root/hello
```

```bash
bin/kvo exec silo hello -n demo -- bash -c "uname -a; df -h /"
```

`exec` runs one command and exits with its exit code, so it works in scripts. It goes through the
worker's dial-out channel: no SSH, no open port on the host, and every call is checked against your
permissions and written to the audit log.

> **Is it locked down?** Each VM's hypervisor runs as its own unprivileged user, with no
> capabilities, a system-call filter, and access to only its own disk and network device.

---

## When an init step fails

The silo stays up (so you can look inside) but never becomes Ready, and `describe` shows which step
failed and the end of its output:

```
Conditions:
  TYPE        STATUS  REASON      MESSAGE
  InitFailed  True    StepFailed  step python exited 1: …
```

Fix the step in `hello.yaml` and `apply` again.

---

## Clean up

```bash
bin/kvo delete silo hello -n demo
```

The VM, its disk and its network device go away on the host.
