# Operating a cluster

The day-two tasks, and where to look when something isn't right.

---

## Where things are

**On a control-plane host:**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/usr/local/bin/kevasod` | The program (installed only after its signature verifies) |
| `/etc/systemd/system/kevasod.service` | Its service |
| `/var/lib/kevaso/` | The store, the cluster CA (`pki/`), the master key (`kms/`), `audit.log`. Root only. |
| `/run/kevaso/admin.sock` | The admin socket: root on this host can do anything through it (bootstrap and break-glass) |

**On a worker:**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/var/lib/kevaso-silos/` | VM silos: one directory each (state, cloud-init seed, serial log) |
| `/var/lib/kevaso-containers/` | Container silos |
| `/var/lib/kevaso-openshell/` | OpenShell gateways and sandbox state |
| `/etc/kevaso-silos.nft` | The silo firewall Kevaso last applied |

**On your computer:**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `~/.kevaso/config.yaml` | `kvo` contexts (or `$KVO_CONFIG`) |
| `~/.kevaso/signing.key` | The key `kvoadm` signs `kevasod` with before installing it |
| macOS Keychain, `com.kevaso.kvo` | Your sign-in tokens |

---

## The audit log

`/var/lib/kevaso/audit.log`, one JSON object per line:

```json
{"time":"…","user":"bob","type":"user","verb":"create","resource":"silos/exec","namespace":"payments","name":"api","allowed":true,"reason":"RoleBinding payments/bob (ClusterRole editor)"}
```

| What's in it | |
|---|---|
| Every decision about a person or service account | Allowed and refused |
| Sign-ins, refresh-token reuse (a stolen token), disabled users | `"event"` says which |
| Every secret value read | `"verb":"read-value"` |
| Every broker call from a silo | `"event":"broker"`, as `system:silo:NS:NAME`, via its host |
| Hosts and kevasod itself | Only when refused (they're busy) |

Values are never written to it. It rotates at 100 MiB.

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/lib/kevaso/audit.log | jq -c 'select(.allowed == false)'
```

---

## Hosts

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| See them, with runtimes and leases | `kvo get hosts`, `kvo describe host hv2` |
| Take one out for maintenance | `kvoadm host drain hv2` |
| Put it back | `kvoadm host uncordon hv2` |
| The control-plane host runs silos too | `kvoadm host enable-worker root@HOST --ssh-key … --runtime …` |

---

## Keys

| Key | Rotate with |
|---|---|
| Secrets' master key | `kvoadm kms rotate root@HOST --ssh-key …` |
| A leaked recovery key | `kvoadm kms rotate root@HOST --ssh-key … --new-recovery-key` ([Secrets]({{ '/secrets/' | relative_url }}#the-master-key-and-the-recovery-key)) |
| A secret's value | `kvo secret set NAME --from-file -` |
| Kevaso's SSH key on your machines | Make a new one ([Installing, step 2]({{ '/setup/prepare/' | relative_url }}#step-2--make-an-ssh-key-for-kevaso)), add its `.pub` to each machine's `authorized_keys`, remove the old line |
| People's access | `kvoadm users disable NAME`: their tokens stop working at once |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Look at |
|---|---|
| A silo stays `Pending` | `kvo describe silo NAME`: the `Scheduled` condition says why no host fits (runtime not Ready, no CPU left, labels…) |
| A silo stays `Starting` | Its conditions and init steps in `describe`; on the host, `journalctl -u kevasod` |
| `InitFailed` | `describe` shows the step and the end of its output; `kvo exec` in to look |
| A host is `Unknown` | It hasn't reported for 40 s: is `kevasod` running on it, can it reach the control plane? |
| A silo can't reach something | Is there a Grant for it, listed in the silo's `grants`? On OpenShell, `describe` shows a `PolicyApplied` condition with what couldn't be enforced |
| `kvo` says `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` | You're talking to another cluster than your context's (another machine on the same address or port?) |

On a host, everything kevasod does is in its journal:

```bash
journalctl -u kevasod -f
```
