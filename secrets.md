# Secrets

The goal: a silo can **use** an API key, a password or a signing key, while having as little of it
as possible inside. Often that's nothing at all.

---

## The four ways, best first

| | Tier | The silo gets | Use it for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Injection** (`deliver: inject`) | Nothing. The key is added to its requests outside the silo. | HTTP APIs: Anthropic, GitHub, Stripe… |
| 2 | **Operations** (`operations.sign`) | Signatures. The key stays in Kevaso. | Validator keys, code signing |
| 3 | **On demand** (`deliver: broker`) | The value, when it asks, over a channel only it has | Passwords, anything that can't be injected |
| 4 | **As a file** (`deliver: file`) | A file in memory (tmpfs), rewritten on rotation | Apps that read a key file |
| — | `deliver: env` | An environment variable. Leaks into child processes, logs, an agent's context: legacy apps only. | Last resort |

---

## Store a secret

Values come from a file or from what you type, **never from the command line** (other users of the
machine and your shell history would see it). With `--from-file -`, `kvo` reads the value from
your terminal:

```bash
kvo create secret anthropic-key -n dev --from-file - --allow inject --write-only
```

Paste the key, press Enter, then Ctrl-D. Or keep it in a file only you can read and give its path:

```bash
kvo create secret anthropic-key -n dev \
    --from-file ~/keys/anthropic.txt \
    --allow inject \
    --write-only
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--from-file F` / `--from-file -` | The value, from a file or stdin |
| `--generate` | Kevaso makes it (32 random bytes; or a new private key with `--type`) |
| `--type ed25519` / `ecdsa-p256` | A signing key: only ever used through `sign`, never readable |
| `--allow inject,broker` | The only ways grants may deliver it, whatever they ask |
| `--write-only` | Nobody can read it back, admins included |
| `-l sensitivity=critical` | Labels: roles can give access by label |

The API never returns a value in `get`, `list` or `watch`. Someone with `read-value` can read a
readable secret:

```bash
kvo get secret db-password -n dev --reveal
```

---

## Give it to a silo: a Grant

```yaml
apiVersion: kevaso/v1
kind: Grant
metadata: { name: claude, namespace: dev }
spec:
  secrets:
    - name: anthropic-key
      deliver: inject
      to: { host: api.anthropic.com, header: x-api-key, format: "{{value}}" }
    - name: db-password                  # deliver: broker is the default
    - name: tls-key
      deliver: file
      path: /run/secrets/tls.pem          # under /run: memory only
  operations:
    sign: { keyRef: validator-key, slashingProtection: true }
---
apiVersion: kevaso/v1
kind: Silo
metadata: { name: agent, namespace: dev }
spec:
  runtime: cloud-hypervisor
  image: ubuntu-24.04
  grants: [claude]
```

```bash
kvo describe grant claude -n dev
```

`describe` says which tier each secret uses.

---

## Injection, in detail

For `cloud-hypervisor` and container silos, the host's **egress gate** sits in front of the silo's
HTTPS to `api.anthropic.com`:

1. The silo's TLS is ended with the host's own egress CA, which Kevaso put in the silo's trust
   store. Only names a grant injects for get this; anything else is refused.
2. Each request must be for that same host (no domain fronting).
3. Whatever the silo sent in that header is **removed**, and the secret is set.
4. The gate connects to the real `api.anthropic.com` itself and checks its certificate.

The program in the silo just calls the API without a key; it works. On **OpenShell** silos the
same grant gives the program an environment variable holding a *placeholder* (`$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY =
openshell:resolve:env:…`), which it sends like a key, and OpenShell swaps the real one in. See
[Runtimes]({{ '/silos/runtimes/' | relative_url }}#openshell).

---

## The broker, for everything else

Each VM has a private channel to its host (vsock); each container, a socket of its own. The host
knows which silo is asking **from the channel itself**, never from what the silo says. Inside, the
helper `kvo-guest` is already installed:

```bash
kvo-guest secret get db-password
```

```bash
echo -n "block 42" | kvo-guest sign validator-key --slot 42
```

```bash
kvo-guest public-key validator-key
```

- Asking for a secret the silo has no grant for answers exactly like a name that doesn't exist.
- A host gets secrets only for silos placed on it.
- `sign` with `slashingProtection` refuses a second, different payload for a slot already signed,
  and any slot before the last.
- Every call, allowed or refused, is in the audit log.

---

## Rotation

```bash
kvo secret set anthropic-key -n dev --from-file -
```

Paste the new key, Enter, Ctrl-D.

| Delivered as | What happens |
|---|---|
| `inject` | The next request carries the new value. Nothing changes in any silo. |
| `file` | The file is rewritten in every silo that has it, within seconds. |
| `broker` | The next `kvo-guest secret get` returns it. |

One secret granted to many silos is renewed once, for all of them.

---

## Who can do what with secrets

Secrets have their own verbs, separate powers:

| Verb | Allows |
|---|---|
| `list` | See that a secret exists (name, labels, version), never its value |
| `use` | Name it in a Grant, i.e. let a silo receive it |
| `read-value` | Read the value as a person |
| `write` | Create, change, rotate, delete |

Rules can target secrets **by label**, so new secrets are covered automatically:

```yaml
kind: Role
metadata: { name: web3-dev, namespace: web3 }
rules:
  - { resources: [secrets], verbs: [list, use], selector: { sensitivity: normal } }
  - { resources: [secrets], verbs: [use], resourceNames: [validator-1-key] }
```

**No back door through silos:** writing a Grant needs `use` on every secret it names, and giving a
silo a Grant needs `use` on that Grant's secrets too. Being able to create silos doesn't give you the
namespace's secrets.

## The master key and the recovery key

Values are stored with **envelope encryption**: each value has its own data key, and only data keys
are wrapped by the cluster's master key (a root-only file on the system node). A stolen copy of the
store opens nothing without it.

The **recovery key** that `kvoadm init` printed is the spare key to your secrets: the master keys are
sealed to it in the store, and the system node keeps only its public half, so it can't use it
itself. Keep it offline, with your other recovery codes. Nobody needs it day to day. It's what opens
your [backups]({{ '/operations/backup/' | relative_url }}): a backup without it can't be restored.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| New master key (re-wraps data keys; the recovery key is unchanged) | `kvoadm kms rotate root@HOST --ssh-key …` |
| The recovery key leaked: new master key and new recovery key | `kvoadm kms rotate root@HOST --ssh-key … --new-recovery-key` |

After `--new-recovery-key`, the old recovery key opens nothing stored from then on. Copies of the
store made before still open with it and hold the values of then: destroy them, and rotate the
secrets that matter.
